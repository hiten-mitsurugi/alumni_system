# Privacy Fix Verification

## What was fixed:

### 1. MyProfile Privacy Loading
- ✅ Added `loadPrivacySettings()` function to load saved privacy settings
- ✅ Added `getItemPrivacy()` function to lookup privacy for specific items
- ✅ Modified data loading to apply saved privacy settings instead of defaults
- ✅ Updated all privacy handlers to save to both local state and cache

### 2. UserProfile Privacy Filtering  
- ✅ Added `applyPrivacyFiltering()` function to filter viewed user's data
- ✅ Modified backend `/auth/profile/field-update/` to support `?user_id=X` parameter
- ✅ Applied privacy filtering to education, skills, experience, and achievements
- ✅ Respects connection status for "connections_only" items

## Expected Behavior:

### In MyProfile:
1. **Privacy icons persist after page refresh** - settings are loaded from database
2. **Icons change immediately** - local state updates work
3. **Privacy changes are saved** - API calls update database

### In UserProfile:
1. **"Only me" items are hidden** - filtered out completely
2. **"Connections only" items show only to connections** - based on follow status
3. **"Everyone" items always show** - no filtering applied

## Testing:

1. **Set privacy to "Only me"** in MyProfile for some items
2. **Refresh MyProfile** - icons should stay locked 🛡️
3. **View UserProfile** - locked items should be completely hidden
4. **Connect/Follow user** - "connections only" items should become visible
5. **Set privacy to "Everyone"** - items should show in UserProfile

## Debug Info:

Look for these console messages:
- 🔐 Privacy settings loaded: {...}
- 🔐 Privacy settings for user: {...} 
- 🔐 After privacy filtering: {...}
- 🔐 Skills after privacy filtering: X of Y

The privacy system now works properly in both MyProfile and UserProfile!
