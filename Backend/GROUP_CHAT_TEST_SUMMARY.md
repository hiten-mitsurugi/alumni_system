## Group Chat Unread Count - Test Summary

### Issues Found:
1. ‚ùå **Default green member count badge showing** - FIXED
2. ‚ùå **Real-time updates not working for group messages** - IMPROVED  
3. ‚ùå **Unread count shows all messages instead of only unread** - BACKEND LOGIC CORRECT
4. ‚ùå **Refresh resets unread state** - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### Changes Made:

#### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Default Green Badge
- Removed the default member count badge that shows even when no unread messages
- Now only shows green badge with unread count when there are actually unread messages

#### 2. ‚úÖ Improved Real-time Group Message Updates  
- Enhanced `group_message_preview` handling with better logging
- Added proper group ID matching logic (`c.group?.id == groupId || c.id == groupId`)
- Added sender check to prevent incrementing unread count for own messages
- Added better debugging logs to trace the flow

#### 3. ‚úÖ Backend Logic is Correct
- The backend properly counts only messages without MessageRead records
- Added debug logging to see what's happening during unread count calculation

### Current Flow:
1. **Backend GroupChatListView**: Calculates unread count using MessageRead model
2. **Frontend group_message_preview**: Handles real-time increments for new messages
3. **Frontend selectConversation**: Resets unread count and sends WebSocket mark_as_read  
4. **Backend handle_group_mark_as_read**: Creates MessageRead records for unread messages

### Testing Required:
1. **Fresh user (no MessageRead records)**: Should show actual unread count, not all messages
2. **Real-time updates**: When User A sends to group, User B should see green background + count
3. **Mark as read**: When User B opens group, count should reset and WebSocket should fire
4. **Persistence**: After refresh, unread count should remain accurate

### Debugging Steps:
1. Check backend logs for the debug message about unread counts
2. Check frontend console for "üîî Processing group_message_preview" messages  
3. Check if WebSocket notifications are being received properly
4. Verify that MessageRead records are being created correctly

The implementation should now work correctly, but needs testing to verify all flows.
